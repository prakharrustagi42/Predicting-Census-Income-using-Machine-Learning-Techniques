# Project Title: Predicting Census Income Using Machine Learning Techniques


**Project Description:**
In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict the annual income of individuals based on census data. The goal was to identify patterns and relationships in the data and develop a model that accurately predicts income.

---

**Methods:**
- Collected and preprocessed the census data using Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- Explored and visualized the data to identify patterns and relationships.
- Built and evaluated several machine learning models, including **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting**.
- Optimized the models using techniques like **hyperparameter tuning** and **feature selection**.
- Evaluated the performance of the final model using metrics such as **accuracy** and **F1 score**.

---

**Key Findings:**
- The **Gradient Boosting** model outperformed the other models, achieving the highest **accuracy** and **F1 score**.
- Important features that had a significant impact on income prediction included **education level**, **occupation**, and **age**.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems and extract meaningful insights from data. The model developed in this project can predict individuals' income and support decision-making across various industries. This project highlights my technical expertise in **Python**, **
